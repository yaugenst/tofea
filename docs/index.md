# TOFEA Documentation

Welcome to the TOFEA documentation. This site is generated with MkDocs and
contains API reference material extracted from the source code. The examples in
the repository show how to solve simple heat conduction and compliance problems
using `autograd` for automatic differentiation.

To build the documentation locally use:

```bash
pip install -e .[docs]
mkdocs serve
